"Lips Are Movin" received widespread comparisons to "All About That Bass" from music critics.[14][30][31] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times considered it one of Title's dozen versions of the latter, which he found as cheerful but also as annoying.[32] Writing for Clash, Alice Levine remarked that the songs have the same "factory-produced sass" and theme of false feminism and empowerment, but being done a second time decreased its novelty.[33] The Boston Globe's Marc Hirsh derided "Lips Are Movin" for following the formula of "All About That Bass", writing that Trainor is a plunderer and "steals from herself" with the song.[34] Spin's Dan Weiss criticized the lyrics and compared them to the age-old joke about lawyers being liars.[35] Toronto Star's Ben Rayner wrote that it is "whitewashed into a fairly anodyne mush", and declared that its "hip-hop bump and plush bassline" are "pure cosmetic window dressing". He considered them an attempt to make Trainor's "old-timey aesthetic" feel contemporary.[36]Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the borough of Queens in New York City,[4][5] the fourth child of Fred Trump, a Bronx-born real estate developer whose parents were German immigrants, and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, an immigrant from Scotland. Trump grew up with older siblings Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth, and younger brother Robert in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, and attended the private Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade.[6][7][8] At age 13, he was enrolled at the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school,[9] and in 1964, he enrolled at Fordham University. Two years later, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968 with a B.S. in economics.[10][11] In 2015, Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen threatened Trump's colleges, high school, and the College Board with legal action if they released Trump's academic records.[12]

While in college, Trump obtained four student draft deferments during the Vietnam War era.[13] In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a medical examination, and in July 1968, a local draft board classified him as eligible to serve.[14] In October 1968, he was classified 1-Y, a conditional medical deferment,[15] and in 1972, he was reclassified 4-F due to bone spurs, permanently disqualifying him from service.[16]
